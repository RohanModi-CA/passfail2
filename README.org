#+TITLE: Pass/Fail 2

An addon for Anki that removes the wide spectrum of "Again", "Easy",
"Good", "Hard" buttons from your Anki reviews, instead choosing to
offer you only two options: "Pass" and "Fail".

The goal of this addon is twofold:

 1. The wide spectrum of buttons introduces decision paralysis when
    reviewing. This is undesireable as when reviewing you should be
    thinking more about what you're reviewing than what button to
    press.
 2. The "Hard" button in Anki has an effect the opposite of what you
    would desire -- when you find something difficult, it increases
    the amount of time before you review it again, giving you more
    time to forget it. Pass/Fail 2 counters this design by simply
    removing the Hard button in the first place.

* Install

The simplest way to install this addon currently is to ~git clone~
this repository into your Anki addons folder.

On Linux this folder is ~~/.local/share/Anki2/addons21/~ for Anki
2.1.x, so you would do the following.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cd ~/.local/share/Anki2/addons21/
$ git clone https://github.com/lambdadog/passfail2
#+END_SRC

Currently I don't publish this addon on AnkiWeb or publish any GitHub
releases, so it's not possible to install it that way.

I run this addon on Anki 2.1.15, and I've observed some minor changes
in the code I'm modifying in newer versions. I can't say for sure that
it will work for other versions as I haven't tested it, but as far as
I can tell it looks likely that it should. If you choose to run this
addon on a newer version of Anki and something doesn't work, please
report the error to my [[https://github.com/lambdadog/passfail2/issues][issue tracker]], thanks!
